## DOY: The first app exclusively devoted to the creation and broadcast of live online events.

DOY is an app which gathers and centralizes events created by users and aimed at all sorts of people, no matter their age, condition or genre.

In this platform, you will learn how to cook that dish you've always wanted, that dance you've never dared to start, or just have a conversation with some random person to get to know them better.

## Technical overview
From a technical perspective, the app is organized in modules, following CLEAN architecture and SOLID principles, having the following structure:
```
app -> presentation -> domain/commons <- data <- networkdatasource/diskdatasource
```
